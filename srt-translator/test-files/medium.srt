00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Today we're testing batch translation.

00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,000
This file has exactly 30 cues.

00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,000
Testing context windows...

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,000
<b>Bold text</b> should be preserved.

00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,000

This is cue number ten.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,000
Second batch should start around here.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,000
If batch size is 25, we're in batch 1.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,000
Testing overflow behavior.

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,000
<font color="#FF0000">Red text</font>

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,000
Halfway through!

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,000

00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,000
Line twenty-three.

24
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,000
Line twenty-four.

25
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,000
Exactly at batch boundary!

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,000
Second batch if size=25.

27
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,000
Line twenty-seven.

28
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,000
