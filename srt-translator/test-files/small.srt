Hello, world!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,500
This is a simple subtitle file.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It has three cues for testing.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
<i>This one has HTML tags</i>

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
{\an8}And this has SRT style tags

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's test context-aware translation!

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Multiple lines
in one cue
should work fine.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Testing timecode preservation...

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Almost done with our test!

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Final cue. Thank you!
