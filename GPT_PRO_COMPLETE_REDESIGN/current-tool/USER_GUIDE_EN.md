## FAQ

### ❓ What is ProxyPal?

An app that connects Cursor/Copilot to multiple AI models. If you use Cursor, you already have it!

### ❓ Do I have ProxyPal?

Check:
- Do you use Cursor IDE?
- Is there a ProxyPal icon in system tray?
- If yes → Use it for free!

### ❓ Will translating affect Cursor?

Very little! Because:
- Subtitle translation uses minimal quota
- ProxyPal manages quota smartly
- Only very large files (5000+ lines) might impact

### ❓ What if I don't have ProxyPal?

Use OpenAI/Claude with API key (paid). Still very cheap (~$0.15/1000 lines).

### ❓ How long does translation take?

- 100 lines: ~30 seconds
- 500 lines: ~2-3 minutes
- 1000 lines: ~5 minutes

### ❓ Is translation accurate?

✅ Very accurate! Uses GPT-4/Claude:
- Human-level quality
